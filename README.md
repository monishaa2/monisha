The Basic Calculator project aims to create a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is designed for individuals who want to practice programming fundamentals and gain hands-on experience with functions, user input, and conditional statements.

Implementation
           The calculator is implemented in Python, utilizing functions to modularize the code and enhance readability.
           It uses a simple console-based interface, making it accessible to users with different programming backgrounds.
           The code structure follows a sequential flow, starting with the display of the menu and then executing the chosen operation.
